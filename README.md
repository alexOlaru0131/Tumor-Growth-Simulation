# Tumor-Growth-Simulation

This project is a simulation for the evolution of a tumor based on its' genetic code. Tumors are abnormal masses of cells that develop on an organ or a specific tissue, require a blood supply to grow (in anatomical terms: angionesis) and can have a variable grow.

For this simulation, there are two classes: 'Tumor' and 'Simulation'.
